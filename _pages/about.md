## The Team:

### Drew Reed (Scrum Master)
Hi, I'm Drew Reed, a junior at DNHS. As the Scrum Master, I generally oversaw what we decided to tackle each week and how we went about it. One thing I enjoy about this position is that I'm not limited to just organizing, either: if there's something in backend or frontend that needs to be done and I know how to do it, I can go ahead and do it. I ended up doing a lot of frontend work, as that was the majority of our project.

### Devon Shepard (Backend Developer)

### Jagger Klein (Frontend Developer)
Hi, I'm Jagger Klein, a senuor at DNHS. My role as Frontend Developer, I basically worked on most of our HTML and CSS work. I created the framework for what our project would look like and helped build the theme of our site. I created an extra fastpages for what our website would be stored on.

### Trent Cardall (DevOps)
Hi! I'm Trent Cardall, a senior at DNHS. My role as DevOps mostly involved deployment and management of code. Although I didn't directly work on much of the program, it wouldn't work without me! I worked in an AWS instance to allow our backend data to be accessible by the Work Watch, which allows it to use some of the great features such as the alarm which people voted for.
