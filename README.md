# What is the Work Watch?

The Work Watch is a web-based, customizable stopwatch program that assists users in organizing and staying focused during work sessions. In conjunction with to-do list functionality, the Work Watch allows users to establish the frequency and duration of breaks in their work sessions. When a break should occur and end, an alarm is played depending on which one was voted to be the favorite among users, with votes stored in a backend database and compared when the site is loaded.

This was our first computer science project, so we were trying our best to utilize GitHub features like issues to the best of our abilites. Here's a link to our early [Scrum Board](https://github.com/drewreed2005/The-Watchers/issues/1). Links within show weekly progress stored in issues.
