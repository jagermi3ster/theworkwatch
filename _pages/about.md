Hi! I'm Trent Cardall, a senior at DNHS. My role as DevOps mostly involved deployment and management of code. Although I didn't directly work on much of the program, it wouldn't work without me! I worked in an AWS instance to allow our backend data to be accessible by the Work Watch, which allows it to use some of the great features such as the alarm which people voted for.
