The Work Watch is a web-based, customizable stopwatch program that assists users in organizing and staying focused during work sessions. In conjunction with to-do list functionality, the Work Watch allows users to establish the frequency and duration of breaks in their work sessions. When a break should occur and end, an alarm is played depending on which one was voted to be the favorite among users, with votes stored in a backend database and compared when the site is loaded.
